Hey guys,

I implemented the class 'InputParser', and it should work now, but let me know if you try to use it and it doesnt. To use it, just instantiate a new InputParser and then call the getListOfEvents method.

    InputParser parser = new InputParser();
    List<Event> eventList = parser.getListOfEvents();


Its not pretty inside the class but it should work for the prototype.  The List<Event> returned should have Events that are fully populated based on the DukeBasketBall.xml file.
